AI based crop recommendation system

Problem Statement - Selecting Crops for farmers is a hectic job as they have to consider many different factors. Hence, developing an app which will help farmers in making their jobs easy.

Aim - The aim is to design an AI based crop recommendation application which can recommend different crops to the farmers by analysing all
the relevant factors for a particular land area such as rainfall, temperature, season, ground water available, soil type and location. The application is based on Deep Learning and Machine Learning algorithms to detect the soil type given an image and recommend the best fit crop along with further suggestions for that very crop such as expected revenue generated per hectare, demand of the crop, required fertilizers, cost of cultivation per hectare, quantity of seeds per hectare, duration of cultivation and the crops which can be used for mixed cropping with the primary crop.
